- Functions rules
    - Small
    - Do one thing
    - Use descriptive names
    - Prefer fewer arguments
    - Have no side effects
    - Don't use flag arguments
- Comments rules
    - Always try to explain yourself in code
    - Don't be redundant
    - Don't add obvious noise
    - Don't use closing brace comments
    - Don't comment out code. Just remove
    - Use as clarification of code
    - Use as warning of consequences
- Source code structure
    - Separate concepts vertically
    - Related code should appear vertically dense
    - Declare variables close to their usage
    - Dependent functions should be close
    - Similar functions should be close
    - Place functions in the downward direction
    - Keep lines short
    - Don't use horizontal alignment
    - Use white space to associate related things and disassociate weakly related
    - Don't break indentation
- Objects and data structures
    - Hide internal structure
    - Prefer data structures
    - Avoid hybrids structures (half object and half data)
    - Should be small
    - Do one thing
    - Small number of instance variables
    - Base class should know nothing about their derivatives
    - Better to have many functions than to pass some code into a function to select a behavior
    - Prefer non-static methods to static methods
- Tests
    - One assert per test
    - Readable
    - Fast
    - Independent
    - Repeatable
    - Code smells
    - Rigidity
    - Fragility
    - Immobility
    - Needless Complexity
    - Needless Repetition
    - Opacity. The code is hard to understand
- Anti-patterns
    - Avoid use of Singleton
    - Avoid use of Marker Interface
